# AwSW Translator's Toolkit

This repository contains tools for generating Ren'Py translation files
(and mod scripts interacting with the translation subsystem) for the game
_Angels with Scaly Wings_.

The tools have been used in the past to generate translation lines for the
game's French translation mod, Spanish translation project, and some Russian
mod translations.

## Usage

If you are looking to translate the game into a brand new language nobody has
translated it to yet, follow the steps in [GAME_TRANSLATORS.md](GAME_TRANSLATORS.md).

If you are looking to create a translation mod for a language and mod that
already exist, follow the steps in [MOD_TRANSLATORS.md](MOD_TRANSLATORS.md).

If you are the author of a mod looking to incorporate the translation systems
into your base mod, so foreign users do not need to download a translation mod
for your mod, follow the steps in [MOD_AUTHORS.md](MOD_AUTHORS.md).
